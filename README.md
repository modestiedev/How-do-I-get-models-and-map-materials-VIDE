# How-do-I-get-models-and-map-materials-VIDE

When you get through GMPublisher map `.bsp` then along with this you get two folders, these `materials` and `models` (sometimes there is a 3 folder is `sound`) , but sometimes that you get only map and materials and models folder is not, in this case you need to download the program **VIDE** after you have downloaded run it. After that you need to click on Package Viewer and a small menu will open https://imgur.com/a/lF5Sd0Q .

Then you need to click on Open and find your map https://imgur.com/a/lqgoaSH .After this you will see the files materials and models , to extract them you need to right-click on the folder and click on extract
